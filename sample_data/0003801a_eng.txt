Article XIX The Company recognizes the principle of seniorit vern, subject to reasonable consideration of skill, effi c o t i o n s , ~ r a n s f e r s , and ~ ~ s Time off due to sickness or accident must be certified by a licensed physician, licensed dentist or licensed chiropractor. An employee who is on authorized leave of absence on Union business shall retain seniority while on such leave of absence. An employee who has established seniority and is then exemployed by the Union shall retain such seniority for a.p ceeding eleven ( I I ) months. Employment of any new employee probationary until he has worked thirty (30) days within a six month period. Thereafter Article 12.01 shall apply, and the employee shall be placed on the Seniority List in order of hire. (a) Seniority will be applied on a Company wide basis in recalls, promotions, transfers from camp to camp and layoffs. When layoffs are required due to the completion of seasonal operations, or part thereof, the employee will be permitted to transfer to a job to which his seniority and qualifications entitle him. If no jobs are available he will be permitted to replace an emp seniority on a job for which he is qualified provided. (i) The jobs will continue in other districts for fourteen (14) days or more, and (ii) The employee having received advance notice in accordance with Section 12.04 advises the Company prior to the effective day of the advance notice and in writing on forms to be supplied by the Company of his desire to transfer or to be laid off. When layoffs are for less than fourteen (14) days seniority will be applied on a district basis. Prior to an intended layoff which is to last more than fourteen (14) days, the Company will provide the Camp Foreman with a copy to the Union Grievance Committee, with a list of the employees in other districts having the lowest seniority on jobs which will continue for fourteen (14) days or more and which are similar to those being terminated. The number of employees listed in each job classification shall be the same as the number being laid off in the same classification. (b) In transfers from one job classification to another, senior employees shall receive first consideration. In such cases, an employee shall receive the rate for the job to which he is transferred. In case of a temporary change to a lower job classification, the employee shall retain the rate of his previous job classification. For determining the rate of pay for pieceworkers transferred to day work, the rate specified for FellerLimber (Tree Length Skidding) shall apply, or the rate of the job classification, whichever is higher. (c) The Company, when filling vacancies, will do so from within the bargaining unit in accordance with Article XII. Notice of impending vacancies will be posted on the c y p bulletin board for at least five ( 5 ) working days. f It is agreed, however, that temporary appointments may be made without posting for filling vacancies of less than, two (2) calendar weeks duration. Newly created jobs will be the Company for a-period of five (5) woiking days prior to any appointment to such jobs, stating the normal job requirements. Employees shall not be considered for such jobs, unless they apply in writing within the five (5)day period. All jobs will be filled from among the qualified applicants on the basis of Section 12.01 of this Agreement. Employees accepting the posted jobs shall be allowed five ( 5 ) work days in which to qualify, (or further time as may be mutually agreed, if additional training is required). Failure of an employee to qualify shall entitle him to return to his former job without loss of seniority or benefits. The Company shall post notices in camps showing the names of successful applicants for all posted vacancies and newly created jobs. (d) A job that becomes vacant because the incumbent has had to vacate it due to sickness or injury, vacation, bereavement leave, jury duty, and/or a leave of absence not exceeding thirty (30) work days shall be classified as a temporary vacancy and shall be filled according to the provisions of Section 12.03 (c) and the job posting will note that it is of a temporary nature. The unit of application of seniority on temporary vacancies is the camp. In the event that a vacancy is not filled from the Camp unit, it shall be filled on a Company wide seniority basis. The employee who had occupied the job upon his return to work shall once again occupy the job that he had filled prior to vacating for any of the reasons set forth above provided however. that the job is still in effect and it is not filled by a senior employee who for reasons of layoff from his former job has exercised his seniority on this particular job. In case of layoff which is to exceed two (2) working days, the Company will notify, in writing, the men intended to be laid off, at least two (2) working days in advance, id notice to the Union Grievance Committee. The Company agrees that all reasonable effort will be made to give employees as much advance notice of layoff as possible. When the approximate time of recall is known at the time of layoff, employees leaving camp will be informed of such approximate date at that time. But in all cases, notice in writing will be sent to an employee at his given address at least fourteen (14) days before he is required to report for work. Employees will be required to acknowledge receipt of such notice and report for work on the date specified, unless other arrangements have been made in writing. The Company agrees to submit to the Union Office by April 30 of each year an alphabetical list, in duplicate, of employees covered by this Agreement, showing their hiring date following their last break in seniority, and Company seniority rank as specified in Section 12.01 as at March 31 of the same year. This list will show in addition each employee’s occupation and address. A seniority list shall be prepared and posted monthly in each camp showing the Company seniority rank of each employee. An employee who has established seniority in accordance with Section 12.02 of this Article shall retain such seniority for twelve (12) months during layoff. However, for any employee not recalled the twelve (12) month period shall be extended for another twelve (12) month period if requested in writing by the employee affected or by the Union on his behalf. An employee who quits of his own accord or is discharged and not reinstated, or fails to report to work following recall as provided in Section 12.05 of this Article, shall automatically lose all seniority. An employee who fails to return from le shall lose his seniority unless his retu circumstances beyond his control. Any employee promoted or transferred to a position with the Company outside the bargaining unit shall retain his seniority for a period not exceeding eleven (11) months from the date of promotion or transfer and shall have the right to exercise his seniority in accordance with all provisions of this Article upon proof of Union membership in good standing. Supervisory personnel who are generally employed on seasonal operations and who have not acquired seniority, in accordance with this Article, may be placed on jobs listed in the bargaining unit, during the off season, provided that this does not interfere with the application of seniority of any employee. Such personnel shall apply for Union membership prior to being placed on the job and maintain their Union membership in good standing. When jobs are discontinued due to the introduction of new methods and equipment or curtailment of operations, affected employees shall be offered alternate employment, in accordance with Section 12.01 of Article Xil, to meet the Company's labour requirements and if such employees require training to perform alternate employment effectively they shall be trained by the Company.
